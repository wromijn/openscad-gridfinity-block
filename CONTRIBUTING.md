# Guidelines for contributing

Thank you for reading this file and showing an interest in contributing to the project!

## Project scope
I want this library to be a general purpose base for projects. If you create additional cutout shapes for it, that's great!
The Apache 2.0 license allows you to include Gridfinity Block in your project either as a separate file or by copying the code, as long as you retain the copyright notice.

## Welcome contributions

Pull requests for these things are happily received:

- Changes that improve compatibility with different Gridfinity setups, like additional feet types or configurable magnet holes.
- Bug fixes
- Code changes that improve readability or maintainability

## Changes that will be refused

- Changes that break compatibility with previous versions of the library.
- Additional cutout shapes. You are welcome to release specialized shapes in a library of your own.
